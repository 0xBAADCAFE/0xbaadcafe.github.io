Sometimes installing android studio's required SDKs and NDK is hussle on its own.
Fortunatly, [zhy0](https://github.com/zhy0 "zhy0") made all the required downloading and configuration ( setting up the PATHs, etc.) availabe in one script.

1. Download [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/zhy0/66d4c5eb3bcfca54be2a0018c3058931/raw/13517f4edbbb8b6320dd76a7893a817a32a0a82b/ubuntu-cli-install-android-sdk.sh) and save it to your _/home_ folder.
2. Open terminal and run sudo ./ubuntu-cli-install-android-sdk.sh
3. Sit back and chill.

Don't forget, you maybe asked to press Y/n in some steps during the installation so don't leave your pc alone.
